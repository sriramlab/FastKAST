This folder has been updated with both the [FastKAST](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40346-2) and [QuadKAST](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2024/08/29/gr.279140.124)


## Requirements
1. You need python >= 3.60 in order to run the code (anaconda3 recommended)
2. `pip install .`

You can either follow the standard pipeline `FastKAST_annot.py` and `QuadKAST_annot.py`, or import the neccessary function to build based on your own I/O.

## Exmaple
To run the demo FastKAST code with a customized window size, you can generate a annotation file with "start_index end_index" as a row, and run
```
python FastKAST_annot.py --bfile ./example/sim --phen ./example/sim.pheno --annot ./example/sim.new.annot
```
Or directly run
```
sh run_rbf_annot.sh
```
